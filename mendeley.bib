The integrated system comprises of a compressor, a combustion chamber, a gas turbine, a triple-pressure (low, medium and high pressures) heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) system, an absorption chiller cycle (ACC), and a multi-effect desalination (MED) system. Low pressure steam produced in the HRSG is used to drive absorption chiller cycle, medium pressure is used in desalination system and high pressure superheated steam is used for heating purposes. For thermodynamic and thermoeconomic analysis of the proposed integrated system, Engineering Equation Solver (EES) is used by employing mass, energy, exergy, and cost balance equations for each component of system. The results of the modeling showed that with the new design, the exergy efficiency in the base design will increase to 57.5%. In addition, thermoeconomic analysis revealed that the net power, heating, fresh water and cooling have the highest production cost, respectively.},

Given the multidisciplinary nature of these studies, it is important that a common understanding of the complexity and nuances of mineral supply chains be developed. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of these assessment approaches and expand on several areas that are conceptually difficult to account for in these studies. These include the dynamic nature of relationships between reserves, resources, cut-off grades and ore grades; the ability to account for local economic, social and environmental factors when performing global assessments; and the role that technology improvements play in increasing the availability of economically extractable mineral resources. Advancing knowledge in these areas may further enhance the sophistication and interpretation of studies that assess mineral resource depletion or availability.},

  abstract      = {We analyse the changes to agricultural metabolism in four municipalities of Vallès County (Catalonia, Iberia) by accounting for their agroecosystem funds and flows during the socioecological transition from organic to industrial farming between the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The choice of three different stages in this transition allows us to observe the transformation of its funds and flows over time, the links established between them and the effect on their energy profiles. We emphasize the relevance of the integration and consistency of agroecosystem funds for energy efficiency in agriculture and their role as underlying historical drivers of this socioecological transition. While readjustment to market conditions and availability and affordability of external inputs are considered the main drivers of the transition, we also highlight the role of societal energy and nutritional transitions. An analysis of advanced organic agriculture c. 1860 reveals the great effort required to reproduce soil fertility and livestock from the internal recirculation of biomass. Meanwhile, a balance between land produce and livestock densities enabled the integration of funds, with a positive impact on energy performance. The adoption of fossil fuels and synthetic fertilizers c. 1956 reduced somewhat the pressure exerted on the land by overcoming the former dependence on local biomass flows to reproduce the agroecosystem. Yet external inputs diminished sustainability. Partial dependence on external markets existed congruently with internal crop diversity and the predominance of organic over industrial farm management. A shift towards animal production and consumption led to a new specialization process c. 1999 that resulted in crop homogenization and agroecological landscape disintegration. The energy returns of this linear feed-food livestock bioconversion declined compared to earlier mixed farming. Huge energy flows driven by a globalized economy ran through this agroecosystem, provoking deep impacts at both a local and external scale.},

  abstract      = {Minerals and the metals derived therefrom are non-renewable resources that deliver a wide range of goods and services to mankind. While their value has been recognized since thousands of years, their large-scale industrial production only really took off after World War II, thanks to the availability of efficient industrial production processes and of a rapidly rising demand, driven by demographic growth, urbanization and growing economic affluence in developed countries. The fast development of the Chinese economy, with about 300 million people reaching middle-class status and migrating to cities, drove a boom demand for minerals and metals of unprecedented magnitude in terms of tonnages consumed, that lasted from 2002 to 2013. Over a century, from 1914 to 2013, the production and consumption of pig iron, manganese and copper grew by a factor of 20, that of chromium by a factor of 182 and that of phosphate by a factor of nearly 42, while humanity grew only by a factor of about 4. Driven by demographic growth, continuing urbanization and growth of the global middle class the demand for minerals and metals will continue to exponentially grow. A scenario is proposed assessing what the theoretical requirements could be up to 2050 for minerals and metals commonly used in the construction industry, to develop infrastructure, for the mass production of metal intensive goods such as cars or in agriculture, to provide our food. The scenario, built on the trends observed since 1950, foresees that, by 2050, the demand for aluminium demand could be eight times the current production levels and the production of cement would need to grow by a factor of 7 to meet the 2050 level of demand. The lead demand would double by 2050. While geological scarcity does not appear to be an issue to feed such a demand, many factors are likely to limit the amount of minerals and metals that can be sustainably produced. Energy and water, both essential to mining, ore processing and metallurgy are likely to be limiting factors, as well as the sustainable management of the enormous amount of waste that would be generated. Public acceptance and access to exploration and mine development financing are other limiting factors to be considered. Inter-generational equity among all the stakeholders is concerned by mining, and intra-generational equity is necessary to ensure that the use of non-renewable natural capital provides benefits that last well beyond the closure of mining operations. This requires equity among stakeholders, including with nature, the silent stakeholder our lives depend on. Overcoming the challenges of the twenty-first century will require the following factors: Decoupling economic growth from its unsustainable negative environmental impacts (UNEP 2011a), inter alia to reduce the pressure on natural resources;Rapid development of a more circular economy based on resource efficiency and the systematic minimization of waste. Flanking policy measures (for instance: European Commission 2016) are needed to close the natural resources loop and avoid the dire predicaments of resources depletion;Institutional strengthening and capacity building to ensure that sustainability agendas are developed and well integrated in corporate strategies and public policies; andTrust among the stakeholders, based on corporate accountability, transparency, stakeholder engagement and reporting of the economic, environmental, governance and social performance of companies.Failure to act on the above requirements at the global scale is likely to be a source of deep crisis where all humanity could lose.},

  abstract      = {The concept of exergy, defined as “the maximum useful work which can be extracted from a system as it reversibly comes into equilibrium with its environment,” can be used in various fields such as industrial ecology or environmental engineering, in order to use energy more efficiently and minimize harmful impacts on the environment.Since the late 1990s, the applications of exergy analysis have been extended into the realm of resource and environmental analysis, for developing integrated analytical frameworks. Not only do the merits of this framework make it an interesting analytical tool for researchers, but also, exergy analysis can be used as a decision-making tool for policy makers for making sustainable choices.For example, the impacts of resource depletion are an integral part of environmental analysis; yet a major challenge in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is to come up with methods to quantify resource depletion. Due to the fact that exergy provides a natural basis for assessing the efficiency of resources use, it has been shown that exergoenvironmental analysis is a more appropriate instrument to quantify the environmental problem of natural resource depletion. Moreover, with the aid of exergetic LCA, the immediate estimation of the exergetic efficiency of processes is provided as well as the comparison of different environmental impacts of different options.This chapter presents a summary of exergoenvironmental analysis, and further, it will discuss methods to apply exergoenvironmental analysis, namely, cumulative exergy consumption (CExC), exergetic life cycle analysis (ELCA), and cumulative exergy extraction from the natural environment (CEENE). Finally, applications in improving resource efficiency and development of sustainable technologies and processes will be discussed.},

  abstract      = {As a specific concept of economics, value does not need to be reduced to any scientific concepts, but as far as a production process can be considered as a process of transformation of ‘wild’ forms of matter into forms useful for humans (dwellings, food, clothes, machinery and so on), one can look for analogies in thermodynamics. Thermodynamic laws are quite general and are applicable to any system, no matter how big and complicated it is, while they do not require a knowledge of the structure of the system in all details. The phenomenon of production can be considered from a general point of view, assuming all our environment to be a thermodynamic system, which is in a far-from-equilibrium state. For the matter to be transformed into shapes of different commodities (complexity), one needs in the creative work of production equipment. The process of production can be regarded as process of materialisation of information, whereby the cost of materialisation is the work of the production system. To maintain complexity in a thermodynamic system, fluxes of matter and energy must flow through the system.},

  abstract      = {Purpose of ReviewThe aim of this study was to analyze the differences and similarities between the concepts circular economy (CE) and cascading utilization (CU) and the interactions between these concepts. The method chosen for this study was a qualitative content analysis, which was conducted on academic CU publications that appeared between 1990 and 2016. To identify connections between CU and CE, the findings of this study are compared to the results of a recent review on CE.Recent FindingsFrom the perspective of the broader goals of CE and CU, both concepts promise to increase resource efficiency by supporting the multiple use of a resource. Research conducted on both concepts has included analyses of the environmental impacts of the CU or CE systems and descriptions of frameworks and tools used to develop cascade chains or measure the circularity of a given resource. Even though the concepts have many similarities, the research has mostly been conducted independently, and the number of connections between the two concepts is surprisingly low.SummaryIn general, the results of the analysis supported the hypothesis that CU and CE have many parallels and similarities. The CU concept addresses primarily resource management whereas CE provides a more holistic approach. Practically, the publications on CE include considerations of many kinds of resources, whereas publications on CU include a stronger focus on bio-based materials. Despite these differences, CU was shown to clearly fit into the CE concept in that it provides a specific focus on the utilization possibilities (e.g., reuse, recycling, and up-cycling) of a given resource. The term CU may be used whenever one or more of these measures are used.},

Conventional approaches, such as mass and energy balances, result insufficient when considering solutions aimed at increasing global energy efficiency. The study presented herein focuses on the application of exergy analysis to the assessment of boilers, which are responsible for considerable exergy destruction in traditional, Rankine-based power plants. The study case considered a coal-fueled water tube boiler with 100 ton/h steam flow rate capacity. Even though exhaust gases presented high energy content, exergy analysis revealed that strategies aimed at minimizing the destruction of the capability to generate work should focus on: (1) heat transfer between exhaust gases and working fluid; and also the (2) combustion process itself. Technological advances applied to the reduction of exergy destruction in (1) and (2) are presented and discussed herein.},

The production functions depend on time texplicitly, when innovations and structural changes induce temporal variations of two technology parameters. The latter model capital effectiveness and the energy demand of the capital stock. In this article, we present some econometric evidence that, in conjunction with capital, the production factor energy provides the major contribution, and the temporal variations of the LinEx technology parameters provide the minor contribution to that part of economic growth that is assigned to “technical progress” by neoclassical economics. We also discuss assets and shortcomings of the two LinEx functions, and different aspects of using either primary energy data or exergy data for the energy variable E.},

  abstract      = {Global demand for electricity is growing every year. Gas turbines are indicated to be one of the cleanest options running on fossil fuels to meet this growing demand. Apart from utility power generation, they are dominating the aviation industry and also being used in maritime industry as prime movers because of their characteristic advantages such as high power/weight ratio, wide operational flexibility, ease of maintenance and high reliability. Forecasts show that gas turbines will dominate the US power production industry in the near future. With growing interest on gas turbines, modifications on simple Brayton cycle are becoming more of an issue. Regeneration is one of these modifications which increases thermal efficiency for the same power output and provides less fuel consumption. Accordingly, employing a regenerator decreases fuel and environmental costs. In this paper, thermoeconomic performance optimization of a closed irreversible regenerative Brayton cycle has been carried out. A precise combustion tool based on chemical equilibrium approach has been used for the specification of adiabatic flame temperature which substantially affects environmental costs. For the optimization, the objective function is defined as the net power output divided by the total cost rate which includes the investment cost, fuel cost and environmental cost flow rates. Effects of isentropic and maximum temperature ratios, compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies, regenerator effectiveness and pressure loss parameter on the thermoeconomic performance of the regenerative Brayton heat engine are investigated. Optimum values for power output, thermal efficiency, investment, fuel and environmental cost rates are specified and discussed.},

After introducing thermoeconomics, the concept of exergy cost and a theory that enables its calculation is presented. Exergy cost of a flow within a system is the amount of exergy resources consumed by that system that are needed for producing the flow. Afterwards, symbolic thermoeconomics is presented in detail; this is a matrix-based methodology that enables not only the calculation of exergy cost, but also other relevant issues such as the effect of residues and the detailed analysis of exergy cost formation. In a following section, thermoecological cost is presented; this cost is also based on exergy but has the main differences that it only takes into account non-renewable exergy resources and considers also the effect of emissions of harmful substances. Finally, a methodology for connecting thermoecological cost with symbolic thermoeconomics is presented. Simple examples have been introduced along the chapter in order to show the capabilities of the proposed approaches. Furthermore, the concepts and formulae introduced will be applied in later chapters of the book.},

The second example is devoted to thermo-ecological assessment of combined cold-heat-and-power plant CCHP plant supported with renewable energy. The aim of this analysis is to apply the exergo-ecological analysis for selected CCHP trigenaration system based on two renewable resources (biogas/solar radiation). The third example concerns the recovery of exergy from pressurized natural gas. The recovery system comprises a two-stage turbine expander integrated with a co-generation module. The example demonstrates the usefulness of exergy analysis, which, in contrast to energy analysis, provides tools to indicate and quantify the origin of the generated electricity.

These intrinsic properties can be in fact evaluated from a thermodynamic point of view in terms of exergy. Chapter 6 presents in details how to evaluate resources quality applying exergy.},

It comprises three different but clearly connected sections: exergy cost of water technologies, exergy value of the hydrological cycle and fundamentals, and application and results of the Physical Hydronomics methodology. The exergy cost is a key parameter to be included in any water analysis regarding exergy efficiency. It measures the goodness of the considered technological process when it is compared with the ideal one and it is used to translate the objective exergy measurements into economic figures. The unit exergy cost of water technologies is introduced both in the analysis of the exergy value of the natural hydrological cycle and in the calculation of water costs. In particular, Physical Hydronomics is defined as the application of the exergy analysis to the assessment of costs of water bodies and it has presented interesting results when considered in the European Water Framework Directive implementation for Spanish and European watersheds. The background and main results of these three mentioned issues are presented along this chapter.

  abstract      = {This chapter provides the thermodynamic tools required to assess mineral depletion. Specifically, as mineral depletion is closely linked with declining ore grades in the crust, concentration exergy is the most relevant parameter for its assessment. To this endeavour, the reference baseline to obtain concentration exergies is shown. This reference baseline is assimilated to a resource depleted Earth coined Thanatia, where no concentrated mineral depostis are found and all minerals are at the current average crustal concentration. Minerals are then assessed through exergy replacement costs, calculated as the exergy required to concentrate a substance from Thanatia, to the initial state of concentration found in the original mines. with prevailing technologies. This can be seen thus as a “grave to cradle” approach and accounts for the "mineral bonus" lost through extraction. If one adds to the exergy replacement costs the real exergy costs associated to extract, beneficiate and refine a given mineral, the so-called thermodynamic rarity values are obtained. A certain element of the periodic table is thermodynamically rare if it is scarce in the crust and/or difficult to obtain. Thermodynamic rarity values for different elements is shown and several examples illustrate how these numbers have been obtained. A final example shows how the methodology can be used to assess the thermodynamic criticality of for instace electronic appliances.},

This problem can be overcome by performing thermo-economic analysis extended with the thermo-ecological cost of resources consumed by the plant. The approach allows one to quantify precisely how unit exergy cost is formed. Furthermore, a methodology for quantifying local savings (reduction of components’ irreversibility due to improvements in their operation) and plant savings (reduction of resources consumption) is presented and applied to the example, what points out clearly where resources savings appear and how this positive effect is extended in the productive chain.},

  abstract      = {The theory of thermoeconomics and local optimization were used to investigate how the cost of the resources consumed by a 450 MW power plant varies with the unit cost of the resources consumed, the technical production coefficients of the productive structure and/or the external demand for the products. In order to accomplish this, the costs of exergy of the productive structure were analyzed under three different conditions by using the relevant characteristic equations. In general, it was found that the thermoeconomic cost of a flow consists of two parts, namely the monetary cost of the fuel exergy (natural gas in the present study) needed to produce the flow, that is, its thermoeconomic cost and the costs due to the productive process (cost of capital equipment, maintenance, etc.). The results show that the steam leaving the boiler has the lowest exergy cost, while the condenser has the highest. The sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm was used to obtain the optimized solutions of each major component of the plant. It was found that substantial operational and capital cost benefits were realized by optimizing most of the major plant equipment (boiler, turbines, feedwater heaters and the pumps). However, optimization of the condenser did not yield any cost benefit in capital equipment cost, but did produce some savings in operational cost.},

  abstract      = {PurposeThe concept of exergy can be used in LCA to quantify the value of natural resources consumed in production processes, as well as to assess the environmental impacts of waste streams. Prior studies noted the complexity of exergy accounting for wastes due to the diversity and complexity of waste streams. We develop an improved method to allow for rigorous exergy accounting of both resources and wastes.MethodsThe exergy content of a mass stream depends on many physical characteristics, including temperature, pressure, and chemical composition. We develop a novel matrix reduction technique to reduce data gathering requirements by multiple orders of magnitude. This method predivides the impact matrix into key rows and processes and “rest of economy” flows. Thermodynamic data can then be gathered for key flows emitted by key processes, and all other flows can be modeled using default values with little loss of accuracy.Results and discussionOur method is applied to an example LCA of electricity production via a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) system. The case study finds that life cycle (economy-wide) exergetic efficiency of NGCC electricity production is ≈43 %, compared to a plant-level (local) exergetic efficiency of ≈54 %. The exergy content of life cycle waste flows is contained primarily in chemical exergy and physical exergy of flue gases, with nearly equal contributions. These waste exergy fluxes represent ≈3 % each of total input exergy.ConclusionsThe matrix reduction technique is found to be robust to assumptions about flows that are not directly modeled. By examining ranges of reasonable assumptions about mass flows not specifically modeled, we show that key rows and processes account for the vast majority of exergy content of interventions.},

For animals the active components are muscles, the digestive system, the cardio-vascular system and the brain, while the passive components are bones and skin. In the economy the active components are human workers (actually only their eyes, hands and brains) plus information processing equipment (computers, telephones etc.) and power-projection equipment consisting of engines, motors, generators, and machines with moving parts. Passive capital in the economy consists of structures that exist mainly to support, contain and protect the active capital equipment. The latter also includes “infrastructure” (roads, rails, bridges, tunnels, harbors, pipelines, electrical transmission lines). It also includes knowledge and intellectual capital.},

This chapter discusses available methods and indicators to assess “resource efficiency” beyond the assessment of the quantities of materials used and toward available indicators in life cycle assessment (LCA). According to the classical definition in LCA, natural resources encompass input-oriented environmental interventions (e.g., extraction of abiotic resources, such as oil, ore deposits, fossil, and fresh surface water, as well as biotic resources such as fish and trees). LCA and existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods are seen as a good basis for measuring resource efficiency. Despite several models to assess resource use and depletion within LCA, important challenges remain. Available models do not fully evaluate resource use and availability in the context of their functional relevance for human purposes. For the efficient use of resources, all dimensions of sustainability need to be addressed. Environmental, economic, and social implications of material use and availability have to also be considered. Assessment of resource utilization and efficiency associated with product systems needs to shift toward life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA).},

  abstract      = {Industrial symbiosis, a subfield of industrial ecology, engages traditionally separate industries and entities in a collaborative approach to resource sharing that benefits both the environment and the economy. This chapter examines the period 1989–2014 to “take stock” of industrial symbiosis. First, we look at the earliest days to discuss what inspired industrial symbiosis both in the scholarly literature and in practice. Next, we draw attention to certain dilemmas and sharpen the distinctions between industrial symbiosis and some related concepts such as eco-industrial parks and environmentally balanced industrial complexes. With regard to dissemination of industrial symbiosis ideas, we found that at the country level, China has now received the most attention in industrial symbiosis academic research and this continues to grow rapidly.The final section looks at both theory (conceptual knowledge largely from academia) and practice (on-the-ground experience of public, not-for-profit, and private organizations working to implement industrial symbiosis) as both are essential to industrial symbiosis. A bibliometric analysis of the scholarly work, capturing 391 articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science for 20 years between 1995 and 2014, is used to define and track the types of articles, how the mix of articles has changed over time, and what the most popular journals are. Taking a closer look at the research literature, distinct themes are identified and discussed such as the scale of industrial symbiosis, whether industrial symbiosis is based on planning or self-organization, the role of social factors, and what is known about the actual performance of industrial symbiosis. To assess important issues with regard to practice, we compile a list of industrial symbiosis-related events from database searches of reports, media, and key consulting and business organizations and examine trends, mechanisms, and motivations of industrial symbiosis practice by surveying key practitioners and academics.Since 1989, there has been significant uptake of industrial symbiosis around the world as shown by the increasing number of journal articles and also events on the ground. Industrial symbiosis has become more geographically and institutionally diverse, as more organizations in more countries learn about the ideas and diffuse regionally specific versions. This presents additional opportunities to understand the phenomenon, but also makes the search to embrace a coherent framework more immediate.},

However, the story of ideas underlying current theories of cosmology are too complex to reduce to a few names and dates, although I will start with one. For most modern astronomers, the logical starting point of modern cosmology was Vesto Slipher’s discovery (1912) of the “red shift” (Z) of the in absorption lines for hydrogen (and other elements) in starlight from distant galaxies. The red shift, toward the infra-red part of the spectrum, indicates slightly lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). It can be explained in terms of relative motion, like the “Doppler effect”. (The Doppler effect is what makes the sound of an approaching siren a little higher in pitch than the sound of a siren moving away). By 1920, 36 of 41 galaxies for which data had been obtained, were seen to be moving away from our galaxy, the Milky Way. Current data puts the fraction much higher.},

Compared with the traditional optimization of specific operating parameters, the idea of the energy-consumption benchmark state was proposed. The equivalent specific fuel consumption (ESFC) analytics was introduced to determine the energy-consumption benchmark state, with the minimum ESFC under varying operation boundaries. Models for the energy-consumption benchmark state were established, and the endogenous additional specific consumption (ASFC) and exogenous ASFC were calculated. By comparing the benchmark state with the actual state, the energy-saving tempospacial effect can be quantified. As a case study, the energy consumption model of a 1000 MW ultra supercritical power unit was built. The results show that system energy consumption can be mainly reduced by improving the performance of turbine subsystem. This nearly doubles the resultant by improving the boiler system. The energy saving effect of each component increases with the decrease of load and has a greater influence under a lower load rate. The heat and mass transfer process takes priority in energy saving diagnosis of related components and processes. This makes great reference for the design and operation optimization of coal-fired power units.},

This method takes full account of the inclusion of energy and raw material supply and other external factors (capital, labor and environment) into a comprehensive resource cost assessment. The extended exergy consumption and its intensity quantitatively at the provincial levels of cement production were calculated and then the agglomeration level of exergy use at the regional level was also evaluated. Based on this analysis, their spatial difference in size and efficiency of exergy use at the provincial level were identified. Moreover, their regional characteristics were revealed. Some important results could be drawn as follows. First, the invisible social cost accounted for 1/10 of the total exergy use in cement manufacturing industry, while the energy element shared about 9/10. Second, the gross distribution of exergy use in China’s cement manufacturing industry was mainly concentrated in the eastern region like Anhui and Shandong provinces, and in the western region like Sichuan province. In terms of exergy use, the coal and electricity were the highest of energy costs in the eastern region, whereas the cost of capital, labor and external environmental factors highlighted the invisible social cost for cement production in the central and western regions to some extent. Third, the efficiency distribution of exergy use in China’s cement manufacturing industry illustrated an incremental feature from west to east, especially for the energy, labor and capital efficiencies. An evaluation on the environmental efficiency indicated that provinces or regions like Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Shanxi have undertaken much higher environmental costs. Fourth, the 23 provinces could be classified into eight groups by the Euclidean distance model using the gross and efficiency results of exergy use. Fifth, the high industry concentration degree is the main driving factor of exergy efficiency improvement for cement manufacturing industry in China.},

This approach, called the UFS Model, is based on the splitting of the physical exergy into three terms, namely, internal energy term, flow work term and entropic term. Application of the UFS Model allows the isolation of both valves and condensers in the productive structure. The goal is to obtain the exergetic unit cost of each internal flow and plant product. This alternative approach yields consistent results, because exergetic unit costs are greater than or equal to 1 and the product-fuel ratio of each productive unit is less than or equal to 1. Besides the allocation of the external power cost of the plant, analyses on the irreversibilities of each cycle unit are carried out. Thus, it is shown that the UFS Model can also be used to quantify irreversibilities as well as the conventional exergy analysis.},

  abstract      = {PurposeEnvironmental concerns have been a growing issue when planning energy supply systems for buildings, as the energy demands (presenting seasonal and daily variations) represent one of the most energy-intensive consumptions in industrialized societies. The optimal operation corresponding to different energy demands of a trigeneration system was analyzed by an integrated methodology combining Thermoeconomic analysis and life cycle assessment, in order to adequately allocate the energy resources and the generated environmental loads to the different energy services produced.MethodsThermoeconomic analysis, which is usually used to allocate energy and economic costs, is herein applied to the evaluation of environmental costs and distribution of resources throughout the trigeneration system. Attention is focused on the correct allocation of energy resources and environmental loads to internal flows and final products. Appropriate rules were established to calculate energy and environmental costs.Results and discussionOperation of the system considered the possibilities that surplus electricity could be exported to the national grid and part of the cogenerated heat could be wasted if this resulted in a decrease of operation costs and/or environmental loads. The results obtained show a low-cost and low-emission production with respect to the separate production in different operation modes. It was observed that, in specific periods, the trigeneration system operates wasting part of the cogenerated heat, and, in other periods, part of the electricity produced is exported to the electric grid. The trigeneration system operates in these modes because it results beneficial from environmental or economic viewpoints, achieving a lower economic cost or fewer CO2 emissions.ConclusionsThe methodology presented as well as the allocation method proposal were congruent with the objectives of installing trigeneration systems that supplied energy services with fewer emissions than those of separate production and of equally benefitting the consumers of heat, coolth (“coolth” is used as the noun form of “cool”; opposite of warmth. Not to be confused with cooling, which is the opposite of heating.) (alias cooling energy), and electricity.},

  abstract      = {Thermal management systems (TMSs) are one of the key components of hybrid electric vehicles in terms of their impact on vehicle efficiency, as well as the vehicle’s overall cost and environmental footprint. In this paper, exergoeconomic and enviroeconomic (environmental cost) analyses of hybrid electric vehicle thermal management systems are conducted with respect to various system parameters as well as operating conditions. In the exergy analysis, balance equations are applied to each system component of the TMS, in order to determine exergy destruction rates and calculate the exergy efficiencies of the system and its individual components. In the economic analysis, investment cost rates are calculated with respect to equipment costs, which are determined by cost correlations for each system component, and capital recovery factors. Thus, by combining the two analyses, an exergoeconomic model is created whereby the exergy streams are identified, fuel and productsare defined and cost equations are allocated for each component. The costs from the economic analysis are used to determine the unit cost of exergy, cost rate of exergy destruction as well as other useful exergoeconomic variables for each component. Moreover, an enviroeconomical (environment cost) analysis is also conducted based on the established carbon price associated with the released CO2 to the environment, corresponding to the indirect emissions from the electricity used in the TMS under varying carbon prices and electricity generation mixes.},

  abstract      = {The members of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf have typically addressed water scarcity problems by building energy-intensive desalination plants. Few efforts have addressed water scarcity through metering, pricing, and other efficiency measures to reduce demand. This paper examines how decreased leakage in the water distribution system and decreased residential water use in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, could decrease air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions from desalination plants. We developed a probabilistic model to predict the effects of water use reductions on pollutant emissions from Abu Dhabi's major independent water and power plants, which use a combination of multi-stage flash distillation and multi-effect distillation to produce fresh water from seawater drawn from the Arabian Gulf. We examine three categories of scenarios for reducing water use: increasing the price signal to residential users, instituting demand management programs among residential users, and reducing water loss in the distribution system. Our analysis suggests that water conservation price incentives could reduce air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions by 1% to 5%, depending on assumptions about how households respond to the incentives. Demand-side management programs curbing per capita water use to levels typical of the Singapore or the UK would curb emissions by 10% or 11%, respectively. Reducing water loss during distribution from the current high level of 35% to 15% (similar to loss rates in other developed nations) could cut emissions by more than 3%. Overall, our analysis suggests that high per capita water use contributes to ambient air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in Abu Dhabi.},

Therefore, it is limited and will omit some valuable work unintentionally, mainly because of the vast number of publications in the field. The thermodynamic analyses mainly aim at assessing the thermodynamic imperfections and suggest possible ways of improving these imperfections. In this review, thermodynamic analyses have been summarized under these methodologies: (i) second law analysis, (ii) exergy analysis, (iii) pinch analysis, (iv) equipartition principle, (v) Gibbs free energy minimization, (vi) thermoeconomics, (vii) exergoeconomics, and (viii) extended exergy analysis. The exergy analysis, which is the most popular methodology, is discussed for the following systems: (1) power cycle applications, (2) biomass and coal gasification, (3) solar energy applications, (4) refrigeration, (5) waste heat utilization, (6) distillation column systems, and (7) heat and fluid flow in micro channels. Besides that, statistical and non equilibrium thermodynamics are discussed briefly. One of the main conclusions of this review is that thermodynamic analysis has been confined mainly to heat and fluid flow systems. Thermodynamic analysis with its unifying power may be more useful and effective if it is successfully expanded toward diverse and multi-scale processes in physical, chemical, and biological systems.},

Some graphical representations are shown in which it is possible to determine or represent exergy and exergy balances. The exergy efficiency is introduced based on a general definition of efficiency, and the balance of cost is presented as an additional balance equation to be used in the performance analysis of energy systems. A brief discussion on cost partition criteria is presented to aid the analysis of the cost formation processes of the products of energy conversion processes. Finally, the renewability of energy conversion processes is analysed by means of a renewability exergy index that takes into account the type of inputs, renewable or fossil, the wastes, and the destroyed exergy of a given energy conversion process.},

The standpoint will be economic, but handling exergy instead of monetary amounts. The concept of branching will be established for the cases in which there is more than one output from a piece of equipment, introducing the augmented matrix for the formulation of the exergetic cost balance. Performance evaluation concepts will be rationally defined, thus easing the analysis of industrial processes and setting the unit exergetic cost concept.},

In view of this, the second law of thermodynamics can be directly linked with sustainability and sustainable development. Estimation of a system’s exergy status in order to know the distribution of energy and matter, especially emissions, would help identify the efficiency of the system, hence improving it for sustainable development. In this chapter, the thermodynamic sustainability of biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, and briquettes production from oil palm biomass are investigated via exergy analysis. Most studies on exergy analysis of biofuels production systems do not consider the production of the feedstocks though these stages are materials and energy intensive. The production of oil palm biomass for palm biofuels is assessed for thermodynamic feasibility in this study in order to give a complete overview of the contributions of every single unit within the palm biofuels production systems. Aspen Plus software was used for the mathematical modeling for all the case studies considered in this chapter. Potential causes and improvement options are also discussed in this chapter for sustainable palm biofuels production.},

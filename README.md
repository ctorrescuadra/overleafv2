## Abstract

The exergy cost theory was proposed by Valero et al. (1986) in their “General theory of energy saving”. This theory
has been recognized as a powerful tool in the analysis of energy systems, and it has been applied to the assessment
of alternatives for energy saving, local optimization, and thermoeconomic diagnosis. The paper introduces a new
methodology, based on productive linear models, which provides new and more efficient algorithms to determine
exergy costs and to analyze the cost formation process of products and wastes. This methodology consolidates the
mathematical foundations of the exergy cost theory and enhances the computer implementation of the thermoeconomic
model. The keystone of this new approach is the Flow-Process table, which describes the relationship “Processes
uses flows to produce flows”, and characterizes the productive and dissipative structures of an energy system.

In the second part of the paper is to integrate the new approach to compute exergy costs introduced in
the first part into Thermoeconomic Input-Output analysis (henceforth ExIO). ExIO is a methodology derived from the
Exergy Cost Theory to analyse the cost formation process of energy-intensive consumption systems. This paper
introduces a new and more efficient algorithm to compute the Fuel-Product table, the keystone of ExIO, as well as
a new strategy for computing exergy costs. As application of ExIO, a general formula to compute and analyze the
irreversibility and waste depletion footprint on the production costs, which includes external costs assessment of
system resources, is introduced.
